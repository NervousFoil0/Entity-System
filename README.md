# Entity System
 Entity system implemented within a personal project.
A small snapshot of the entity structure I created for one of my personal project. The aim for the system to allow for expandability within a short development cycle. This was achieve by layering the entity systems with a core baseEntity script handling generic functions such as damage, pathing, ragdoll and other systems. The project also requires large volumes of animations, again with expandability in mind the basic unity animator controller graph can cause issues. So a custom script was created to allow for animations to be added with limited webbing in the controller. When developing new entities such as deer I was able to implement them within less than 1 hour of work with this template.
